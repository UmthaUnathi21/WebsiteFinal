        <h3>Understanding Digital Inequalities</h3>
        <p>There is a disparity between people in the information obtained through technology. This can be anything from general knowledge or researching a topic to more specific tasks such as seeking health advice or buying products and services.</p>
        <p>Another form of digital inequality is the inequality of the skills required to use information technology. People who are on the lower end of the education scale often do not have the technical skills required to make good use of technology. This can put them at a further disadvantage in terms of education and job searching.</p>
        <p>The most commonly discussed type of digital inequality is the inequality of access to information technology. Often, people who are of a lower socioeconomic status have less access to new forms of information technology and are therefore put at a disadvantage compared to their higher-income counterparts.</p>
        <p>Digital inequality, as it is understood today, is the disinterest that arises in individuals and groups as a result of unequal access, use of, or impression of data and communication technology. Digital inequalities can occur between countries and regions or among specific groups of people located in the same country or region. The scope of digital inequality can be quite broad; it encompasses many different aspects of a person's relationship with information technology.</p>

        <h4>Factors Contributing to Digital Inequalities</h4>   

        <p>One simple example of pricing troubles that affect not only low-income homes but also schools and libraries would be the cost of computer software. Often, underfunded institutions are faced with problems of not being able to afford software upgrades or having access to software that is even slightly outdated.</p>
        <p>This only aids in creating a digital divide for these people who are not given the chance to develop or utilize skills and resources that allow effective use of digital technologies. Another commonality is that online services and products are cheaper than their physical counterparts.</p>
        <p>Those not able to access more expensive services and products are missing out on many conveniences, and the same can be said about people who are limited to dial-up or cellular access, which is a much slower connection and often times won't support modern-day internet applications. With the rate technology is being developed and the constant release of newer and better versions of products, it is already hard to achieve digital equality by being able to afford last year's simple technologies.</p>
        <p>When examining affordability, it is easy to conclude that not all individuals or families can afford to have state-of-the-art technologies or even access to the internet. In 2012, the median income for a US household was $51,017. It was noted that less than half of households reported having an actual broadband internet connection in their homes. This statistic alone proves that a significant amount of people rely on other means to access the internet, as opposed to substantial in-home connections or internet-ready cellular devices. When evaluating these statistics, it is important to think that there are families who do not even meet the criteria of the median income, and they are subject to the question of whether the internet should be a safe livelihood or just a luxury. Either way, the cost of numerous methods of digital access is just too expensive.</p>
        <p>There is always a reason for why a certain group of people do not have the same access to a product or service as others have. And the same goes for the reason why there are digital inequalities. There are several factors contributing to these digital inequalities and they can constantly change as technology advances. However, three of the most prevalent causes of these disparities are affordability, social and cultural acceptance, and knowledge.</p>
