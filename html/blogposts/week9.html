        <h3>Importance of Internet Access</h3>
        <p>Information oftentimes is a powerful weapon, and the potential of the internet in giving individuals a resource for information on their rights and the ability to organize to secure them is a large part of internet access being essential to human rights. </p>       
        <p>The internet allows individuals to educate themselves on their rights that are guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, such as freedom of speech, ethnicity, minority or indigenous rights, language, employment, and economic security. For example, those whose rights to free speech are being oppressed now have a virtually free and accessible outlet through the internet to voice their opinions and seek like-minded individuals and groups that can help them take steps towards enforcing their rights.</p>
        <p>Internet access over the last decade has become recognized as a basic human right. It allows and assists individuals in exercising and enjoying their rights. Like all fundamental freedoms, the implications of internet access for human rights have both positive and negative aspects.</p>

        <h4>Challenges to Internet Access in South Africa</h4>   
        <p>Turning to specific human rights, there are a multitude of rights that internet access aids in realizing. For the purposes of concision, these can be categorized under political participation, access to information, and education. The prevention of internet access effectively prevents the realization of these rights by certain individuals.</p> 
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that human rights set out moral principles on the standards by which human beings should live and are thus inherently universalistic, applying to all human beings without discrimination. This essentially means that all persons in South Africa are entitled to the human rights enabled by internet access, and the prevention of access prevents the equal realization of human rights for all persons in South Africa.</p>
        <p>In discussing challenges to the realization of internet access in South Africa, it is prudent to briefly define what is meant by internet access. Internet access can be defined as the ability to connect to the internet to potentially draw upon a wide range of services and connect with other people. Internet access today is primarily in the form of broadband â€“ fast enough to enable the use of all services available on the internet.</p>
        <p>The previously mentioned assertions of human rights providing for the human condition and ability to partake in a meaningful and dignified life are difficult to dispute. The difficulty lies in ensuring that these assertions are meaningfully realized by all peoples, in all areas, and at all times. Challenges to the content and implementation of rights usually arise over who is to provide for those rights, who is to pay, and what is a just and reasonable means of ensuring their delivery to all peoples.</p>
